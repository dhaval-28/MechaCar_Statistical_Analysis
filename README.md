* 1 Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Two Variables : vehicle_length , ground_clearance.  The variance for these two variables is close to 0. 

* 2 Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
No, the slope of the linear model is NOT considered to be zero. p vlaue is less than 5% significance value. It means there are sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and m â‰  0 (alternative hypothesis)

* 3 Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
   Yes it does. r-squared (r2) is 0.68.  To quantify how well our linear model can be used to predict future observations, our linear regression functions will calculate an r-squared value. The r-squared (r2) value is also known as the coefficient of determination and represents how well the regression model approximates real-world data points.

</p>

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. 
* **For all manufacturing lots in total** : total variance is 62 which is less than 100 pounds. So it does mee the specification. 
* **Each lot individually** Lot 3 has variance of 170 which exceed 100. So it does not meet the specifications. 

### Deliverable 3 -  T-Test on Suspension Coils

</p>

* **For all manufacturing lots in total** :  Assuming our significance level was the common 0.05 percent, our p-value is above our significance level. Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and we would state that the two means are statistically similar.

* **For Each manufacturing lots in total** : 
  * Lot 1 & 2 : For Lot1 & 2 , p-value is above our significance level. Therefore , we don't have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, and we would state that the two means are statistically similar.
  * Lot 3 : For Lot3 , p-value is below our significance level. Therefore , there are sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

### Deliverable 4 -  Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. 

*  What metric or metrics are you going to test? :   safety ratings of the MechaCar vehicles are the same as other manufacturers.
*  What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
    H0 : There is no difference in safety rating of the MechaCar vehicles and competitors vehicles.
    Ha : Safety ratings of the MechaCar vehicles are better than the competitors vehicles.

*  What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
    We would use ANOVA test. It would identify statistical difference between the distribution means from multiple samples. 

*  What data is needed to run the statistical test? We would need safety ratings for MechaCar vehicles and other manufacturers.
